burger ingredients:

- 2 pounds ground beef (80% lean)
- 2 tablespoons sweet soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar
- 8 garlic cloves
- 12 shallots
- ¼ cup ketchup
- 1.5 tablespoons coriander, lightly toasted
- 1 ½ - 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 can Coca-cola
- 8 brioche buns

pickle ingredients:
- 2 large tomatoes
- 4 shallots, sliced
- 6 black bird's eye chilies, sliced
- Cider vinegar

garnish:
- fried shallots
- 1 kirby cucumber, sliced

directions:
- Make pickle.  
    - Mix chilies, tomatoes and shallots. Add vinegar.

-  Make burgers.
    - In a food processor, puree toasted coriander, shallots, garlic, sweet soy
sauce and brown sugar, and ketchup. Add Coca-Cola if liquid is needed
to puree.
    -  Pour puree into sauce pan and boil until liquid is reduced to a syrupy
paste and shallots lose raw flavor. Add Coca-Cola if needed to deglaze
pan. Turn pan off and cool down.
    - Once the paste is warm but not hot, mix into ground beef.
    - Shape beef into patties, leaving an small/thumb-sized indentation in the
top center of the patty. (This prevents the burger from puffing into a round
ball when cooked.)
    - Grill until cooked through.
    - Place burger patty on brioche bun and top with pickle and fried shallots. Pour
sweet soy sauce on top to taste.
    - Garnish with additional pickle and cucumber.

For this dish, I combined the amazing flavor of sate maranggi purwakarta with the
American classic: the burger. As a burger, the bun soaks up the juices and contains
the tomato pickle, sweet soy sauce and spiced beef to provide all of the flavors in a
single bite. To further Americanize the dish, I added ketchup to the meat mixture to add
sweet-salty-sour-tomato flavor and used Coca-Cola to deglaze cooked shallot paste.
